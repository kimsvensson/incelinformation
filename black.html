        <h1>> HOPELESSNESS</h1>

        <h2>BLACKPILLING</h2>
        * Blackpilling refers to the belief that the dating and social dynamics of society are fundamentally rigged
        against certain individuals. Particularly those who are perceived to be physically unattractive or socially
        awkward.
        <br>
        <br>
        * This belief can lead to feelings of hopelessness, despair, and a sense of being trapped in a situation with no
        way out.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>SUICIDAL IDEATION</h2>
        * In some cases, blackpilling can lead to suicidal ideation and attempts, as well as self-harm.
        <br>
        <br>
        * When individuals believe that their prospects for finding love and happiness are limited by factors beyond
        their control, they may feel a sense of hopelessness and despair. This can lead to a sense of futility and
        helplessness, which can contribute to suicidal ideation.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Incels and those who subscribe to blackpill ideology often report feeling socially isolated and disconnected
        from others. This isolation can exacerbate feelings of hopelessness and contribute to suicidal behavior.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Blackpill ideology reinforces negative beliefs about oneself and others, such as the idea that physical
        attractiveness is the most important factor in determining one's worth as a person.
        These beliefs can contribute to feelings of low self-esteem and depression, which can in turn lead to suicidal
        behavior.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>VIOLENCE</h2>
        * Although most incels do not engage in violent behavior, there have been a number of high-profile incidents in
        which self-identified incels have committed acts of violence.
        <br>
        <br>
        * These examples demonstrate the potential for incel ideology to fuel violent and harmful behavior.
        It is important to recognize the harmful attitudes and beliefs that contribute to this ideology, and to work
        towards promoting respect and inclusivity towards all individuals, regardless of gender or other factors.
        <br>
