        <h1>> WORLDVIEW</h1>
        <h2><b>VICTIMHOOD</b></h2>
        * Incels view themselves as victims of what they see as an unfair and unjust society that has denied them the
        ability to have sexual and romantic relationships.
        <br>
        <br>
        * They feel that society has created a hierarchy of attractiveness and social status that places them at the
        bottom, making it impossible for them to find partners.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Incels often believe that their lack of success in finding sexual and romantic partners is not their fault,
        but rather the fault of external factors beyond their control, such as physical appearance or social status.
        <br>
        <br>
        * They may view themselves as inherently undesirable and unattractive, and believe that their lack of success in
        finding partners is due to factors such as height, facial features, or body type, rather than their own actions
        or behavior.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>MISOGYNY</h2>

        * Incels tend to have a highly negative view of women, whom they see as manipulative, shallow, and selfish. They
        often engage in misogynistic speech and behavior, including promoting rape, violence against women, and other
        forms of misogyny.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Incels often believe that women are solely responsible for their inability to find sexual and romantic
        partners. They may view women as shallow and only interested in men who are conventionally attractive or have
        high social status, rather than valuing other qualities such as kindness or intelligence.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Incels often view women as objects to be obtained or conquered, rather than as individuals with their own
        thoughts, feelings, and desires. They may express misogynistic attitudes toward women, such as referring to them
        as "femoids" or "sex objects."
        <br>
        <br>
        * Some incels have been involved in mass shootings and other violent incidents, claiming that their actions are
        motivated by their frustration with being unable to find sexual partners. Incels may also promote rape or other
        forms of violence against women as a means of asserting power and control over them.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Incels often use online forums and social media to spread hateful and derogatory messages about women. They
        may use misogynistic slurs, post offensive memes or images, or engage in cyberbullying or harassment.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>ENTITLEMENT</h2>
        * Incels may feel that they are entitled to have sexual and romantic relationships simply because they exist,
        rather than recognizing that relationships require effort, communication, and mutual respect.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Incels often believe that their lack of success in finding partners is due to external factors, such as
        physical appearance, social status, or societal expectations, rather than recognizing that their behavior or
        attitude may be contributing to their lack of success.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Incels may view those who are successful in dating as having achieved their success through luck or
        superficial factors, rather than recognizing that successful relationships require effort, empathy, and
        communication.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Incels may believe that they are entitled to immediate gratification in the form of sexual or romantic
        relationships, rather than recognizing that relationships require time, effort, and patience to develop.
